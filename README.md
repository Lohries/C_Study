# C_Study
This repository has the purpose of developing C programming skills at all levels. Here, you can see how I personally learn the basics of syntax and concepts of programming in general. That's why I think that learning C is so important at the beginning; it is easy, fast, and opens the path to more challenging and versatile languages.
